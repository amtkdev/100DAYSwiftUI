Day 2:

How to store truth values with Booleans and how to work with them quickly.

How to join strings together.

Summary:

We were introduced to the Boolean type, which can store only true or false values.
We also learned how to use operators like ! (not) and the .toggle() method to change a Boolean’s value.

We explored string interpolation, which is much more powerful and readable than concatenation (e.g., using var + text + var) or manual conversions like String(Int).
Interpolation makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

Swift allows us to create both let (constants) and var (variables), but Paul highly recommends using let whenever possible to avoid mistakes.
Constants are also slightly more efficient in Swift’s memory management.

Extra notes:

In Swift, strings contain text — from short words to long paragraphs — and we define them using double quotes (" ").

Swift uses Int for whole numbers and Double for decimal numbers.

To store true or false, we use the Bool type.

String interpolation is a powerful and efficient way to include variables or expressions inside strings, making code clear and easy to read.



Checkpoint 1:
Paul challenge us to create a conversion app simple that can do temperature, length and time. 
-I create some vars using @State to manipulate de values about reading and writing
-switch case, to select which option the person chose
-UnitTemperature, UnitLenght, and UnitDuration extension wich my cases and let the Swift dll hang that out for us, where you can check the project on https://github.com/amtkdev/ChallengeDAY001
